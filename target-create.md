# Creating a target destination
{: #target-create}

To manage platform logs that are generated by {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} services in a region of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, you must create a tenant in each region that you operate.
{: shortdesc}

{{site.data.content.tenant_definition_note}}

## Before you begin
{: #target-create-prereqs}

Complete the following steps:

1. Review [About {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full}}](/docs/logs-router?topic=logs-router-about) to understand concepts.

2. Install all prerequisite tools as described in the [getting started](/docs/logs-router?topic=logs-router-getting-started&interface=ui#getting-started-before-you-begin-2).

3. Set up permissions to manage targets in the account. For more information, see [Setting up IAM permissions for managing tenants](/docs/logs-router?topic=logs-router-tenant-iam-permissions).

4. To get details on a tenant by using the API, check that you can connect to {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}} by using the management API. For more information, see [Connecting to {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full}}](/docs/logs-router?topic=logs-router-about#about_connecting).


## Retrieving the IAM bearer token
{: #target-create-retrieve-iam-token-cli}
{: step}

You must get an {{site.data.keyword.iamlong}} (IAM) access token to authenticate your requests to the {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full}} service. For more information, see [Retrieving an access token](/docs/logs-router?topic=logs-router-retrieve-access-token).

For example, you can retrieve your IAM bearer token and export it as an environment variable by running the following CLI command:

```sh
export IAM_TOKEN=`ibmcloud iam oauth-tokens --output json | jq -r '.iam_token'`
```
