# Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full}}
{: #getting-started}

Use the {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}} service to collect and route {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} logs to your chosen target. You can route logs from your own {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} workloads, such as applications on [{{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}](https://www.ibm.com/products/kubernetes-service) clusters, and from  {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service instances.
{: shortdesc}

{{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}} uses the concept of tenants and targets.

{{site.data.content.tenant_definition-paragraph}}

To start using the service, you need to:
- Create (onboard) a {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}} tenant in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account in at least one [supported {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} region](/docs/logs-router?topic=logs-router-locations).
- Install and configure the {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}} agent to collect log events.

The following steps can be used to start using {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full}}.

## Before you begin
{: #before-you-begin}
{: step}

Before you start, check that the user who is configuring {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}} for the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} account has sufficient permissions to manage the {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}} service. For more information, see [Managing IAM access for {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}}](/docs/logs-router?topic=logs-router-iam).

Create an [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration) if you do not already have one.

### Installation prerequisites
{: #install-prerequisites}

Install the following tools:
- [Install the Kubernetes CLI (`kubectl`)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/){: external}
- If you are installing the agent on an [{{site.data.keyword.openshiftlong_notm}}](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift) cluster: [Install the Red Hat Openshift CLI (`oc`)](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-cli-install)
- [Download and install the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} CLI](/docs/cli)
- If you do not have an existing {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} instance to use as a target to receive routed logs: [Provision an IBM Log Analysis instance](/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-provision)
- If you are going to be running the agent in an {{site.data.keyword.vpc_full}} and will be using the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} CLI to configure networking, [install the {{site.data.keyword.vpc_full}} CLI plugin](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-set-up-environment&interface=cli)
- [Download and install jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/){: external}

### Collecting required information
{: #collect-required-information}

Collect the following information:
- The full CRN of the {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} instance that will be the target to receive routed logs.
- The {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} [endpoint](/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-endpoints). This _MUST_ be the endpoint for the region where the instance was created.
- The [ingestion key](/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-ingestion_key) for your {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} instance

You can find instructions for retrieving this information [here](/docs/logs-router?topic=logs-router-onboarding&interface=ui#onboarding-retrieve-log-analysis-information).
{: tip}

{{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}} supports only {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} targets.
{: important}

## Enabling connectivity
{: #getting-started-enable-connectivity}
{: step}

Ensure that you can connect to both the management and ingestion endpoints by following the instructions for [connecting to {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}}](/docs/logs-router?topic=logs-router-connecting).

## Creating (onboarding) a tenant
{: #getting-started-onboard-tenant}
{: step}

Create (onboard) a tenant by following [Onboarding to the {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}} service](/docs/logs-router?topic=logs-router-onboarding).

## Installing the {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}} agent on your cluster
{: #getting-started-deploy-agent}
{: step}

The {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}} agent collects logs events from containerized workloads that run on a Kubernetes cluster.

Complete the steps in [Deploying the agent on a cluster](/docs/logs-router?topic=logs-router-deploying-agent).

## Verifying that logs are sent to the destination target
{: #getting-started-verify-logs}
{: step}

Verify that the logs for your cluster are routed to your {{site.data.keyword.la_short}} instance.

[Launch the {{site.data.keyword.la_short}} web UI](/docs/log-analysis?topic=log-analysis-launch&interface=ui) for the target {{site.data.keyword.la_short}} instance and check that logs from your cluster are displayed.
