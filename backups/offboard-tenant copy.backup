# Deleting (offboarding) a tenant from {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}}
{: #offboarding}

You can delete (offboard) a tenant from {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}}.
{: shortdesc}

{{site.data.content.tenant_definition_note}}

## Getting an IAM access token
{: #tenant-remove-step1}

Complete the following steps:

1. Log in to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} by using the [IBM Cloud CLI](/docs/cli?topic=cli-install-ibmcloud-cli).

    ```text
    ibmcloud login [--sso]
    ```
    {: pre}

    For federated users, run `ibmcloud login --sso`.
    {: note}

2. Generate an IAM access token. Run the following command to retrieve your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} IAM access token.

    ```text
    ibmcloud iam oauth-tokens | grep IAM | cut -d ' ' -f 5 | sed 's/^ *//
    ```
    {: pre}

3. Copy the access token into an environment variable.

    ```sh
    export IAM_TOKEN=<insert_access_token>
    ```
    {: pre}

## Deleting (offboarding) a tenant
{: #tenant-remove-step2}

The management endpoint that you call to remove a tenant is only available by using VPE.
{: important}

Run the following command to delete (offboard) a tenant from the {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}} service:

```sh
curl -X DELETE -H "Authorization: bearer ${IAM_TOKEN}" management.private.${REGION}.logs-router.test.cloud.ibm.com/v1/tenants/${TENANT_ID}
```
{: pre}

Where:

- `IAM_TOKEN` is the IAM token that you must use to authenticate the request.

- `TENANT_ID` defines the ID of the tenant that you are removing which was returned when the service was created (onboarded).

- `REGION` defines the region where your tenant is located.
