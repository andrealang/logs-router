# Connecting to {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}}
{: #connecting}

Learn how to connect to {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full}}.
{: shortdesc}

You can connect to {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}} management API by using either a public endpoint or a private endpoint. A public endpoint can be reached over the internet, whereas a private endpoint can be accessed only from within the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} private network.

The ingestion API supports only private endpoints and is therefore not accessible from the public internet.

You can access a private endpoint as either a {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Cloud Service Endpoint (CSE) or a {{site.data.keyword.vpe_full}}.
- If you are connecting from an {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}}, you can connect by using either a CSE or {{site.data.keyword.vpe_short}}.
- If you are connecting from a system that is not contained in an {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}}, your only private endpoint option is to connect by using a CSE.

For more information about {{site.data.keyword.vpe_full}}, see [About virtual private endpoint gateways](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-vpe).



## Endpoints
{: #connecting-endpoints}

{{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full}} provides API endpoints for both management functions, such as creating (onboarding) as a tenant, and ingestion of logs. These API endpoints are separate endpoints that are accessed by using specific URLs in each supported region.

You can find the endpoints for each supported region [here](/docs/logs-router?topic=logs-router-endpoints).


## Using virtual private endpoint gateways
{: #connecting-vpe-gw}

If you are accessing the management API or connecting the agent to the ingestion API from within an {{site.data.keyword.vpc_full}} instance, you might need to [create an endpoint gateway](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-ordering-endpoint-gateway). For more information, see [Using virtual private endpoints for VPC to privately connect to {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}}]().

When you create the VPE gateway, select `logs-router` as the target service. You must create separate gateways for the management and ingestion endpoints. See the list of [{{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}} endpoints](/docs/logs-router?topic=logs-router-endpoints) to find the correct hostnames for your target region.
{: note}

## Using cloud service endpoints (CSE)
{: #connecting-cse}

Connecting to {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}} by using a CSE might not require any additional work on your part. Access to CSEs is only available from within the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} private network. For more information, see [Using service endpoints to privately connect to {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}}]().
